## About <a name = "about"></a>
This project involves creating a simple ruby on rails application with a simple user sign in by name. The sign in is authenticable against user sign up. Once a user is able to sign into the application, a list of events curated by whether they are upcoming or they have ended is presented to the user. The user can click each event to see more details about it. More so, the user can edit their profile and they can see how many events they have created and how many events they have attended. A user is also able to create their own events by clicking the ``New Event`` item in the top navigation bar.

## Pre-coding Planning
Before writing code, the the following constituted the blueprint. 

### Data Modelling
Data modelling was the first step and is described in the associations below:

#### User Model
* ``has_many created_events with foreign_key as creator_id and class_name as User``
* ``has_many event_attendings``
* ``has_many attended_events through event_attendings joining table where source is event``

#### Event Model
* ``belongs_to creator where class-name is User``
* ``has_many event_attendings``
* ``has_many event_attendees through event_attendings joining table where source is user``

#### Event_Attending Model
* ``belongs_to User``
* ``belongs_to Event``

###  App <a name = "app"></a>
With the installations above complete, you are set to use the code and view the application built in this repository. Follow these simple steps:

- Change directory into the directory where you cloned the repository. Forexample ``vanheaven@vanheaven-VirtualBox:~/Microverse-projects$ cd private-event.``
- Run ``bundle install`` in the terminal to install gems and their dependencies.
- Run ``rails db:migrate`` to update the database.
- Run ``rails s`` or ``rails server`` in the terminal to start the server.
- Once the server starts(Might take about 3-5 minutes), you can access the application by typing localhost:3000 in your browser and striking ``Enter``.

## Testing <a name = "tests"></a>
The tests in this repository were written uing Rspec and capybara. So to run these tests successfully on your computer, follow the steps below;
* Crosscheck to make sure that your Gemfile has _**rails-rspec**_ in the development block and _**capybara**_ in the test block. See this example:
   ```<pre>
    group :development do
      gem 'listen', '~> 3.2'
      gem 'web-console', '>= 3.3.0'
      gem 'database_cleaner'
      gem 'rspec-rails'
      gem 'spring'
      gem 'spring-watcher-listen', '~> 2.0.0'
    end

    group :test do
      gem 'capybara', '>= 2.15'
      gem 'selenium-webdriver'
      gem 'webdrivers'
    end
 * Follow [SettingUp RSpec and Capybara](https://madeintandem.com/blog/setting-up-rspec-and-capybara-in-rails-5-for-testing/) guide to fully setup rails and capybara.
 * Then run ``rspec`` in the terminal.
